# Bank Churn Prediction

This repository contains resources and code for predicting bank churn using machine learning techniques. It includes a dataset, a cleaned version of the dataset, and two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating preprocessing and machine learning model development.

## Dataset

The dataset provided here is for predicting bank customer churn. We have included a cleaned version of the dataset for immediate use.

- `Bank Customer Churn Prediction.csv`: The raw dataset.
- `cleaned_df.csv`: Preprocessed and cleaned version of the dataset.

## Notebooks

The project includes two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Data Preprocessing Notebook**
    This notebook focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for model building.

2. **Machine Learning Model Notebook**
    This notebook contains the implementation of machine learning models for predicting bank churn based on the preprocessed data.
